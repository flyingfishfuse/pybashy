"""
This is a most basic example of the command framework

    - you import this file with :
        
        new_command = CommandRunner()
        new_command.dynamic_import('commandtest')

    - All functions become thier own CommandSet()
        >>> isinstance(new_command, CommandSet())
        >>> True
        
        - from "steps" to "failure_message" is considered a CommandSet()
        - All "steps" are turned into Command() 's 
    
    - All CommandSet() are added to ExecutionPool()

    - To Retrieve a list of loaded CommandSet() and thier operations, use:
        - ExecutionPool.list_operations(new_command) 
        - ExecutionPool.list_commands()

    - to run the execution pool, you use the worker_bee() function:

        finished_command = new_command.worker_bee(ExecutionPool(command))


Every command is a dict with an array of four string fields as the value:
    
    {'test1' : ['ls -la ~/','','','']}
    
    Array fields are as follows:
    - Name of Command
    - Command
    - Informational message to print
    - Success message
    - Failure message

Multiple commands can be placed in a dict, that are run sequentially:
    {
        'test1' : ['ls -la ~/','','',''],
        'test2' : ['ls -la ~/','','','']
    }
